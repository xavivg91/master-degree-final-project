# Master's degree final project

My delivery for the final project of the Master's degree in Business Intelligence and Big Data ([Universitat Oberta de Catalunya](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/index.html)).

The principal objective of the project is to analyze tweets captured on World Health Day (April 7th) to create a data storytelling, using Twitter as the main source. 

The project includes the following analysis:

* Statistical and descriptive analysis
* Sentiment analysis: [Bing](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html), [NRC](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm) and [AFINN](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010) lexicons
* Retweet network analysis: most relevant users and tweets, metrics and properties of the network and visualization of the graph (using the [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) software)
* Wordclouds to display the most frequent words
* Geographical analysis of tweets
