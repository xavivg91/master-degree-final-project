# Master's degree final project

My delivery for the final project of the Master's degree in Business Intelligence and Big Data ([Universitat Oberta de Catalunya](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/index.html)).

The main objective of the project is to analyze tweets captured on World Health Day (April 7th) to tell a story through the data, using Twitter as the main source.
