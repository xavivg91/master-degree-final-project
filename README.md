# Master's degree final project

My delivery for the final project of the Master's degree in Business Intelligence and Big Data ([Universitat Oberta de Catalunya](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/index.html)).

The main objective of the project is to analyze tweets captured on World Health Day (April 7th) to tell a story through the data, using Twitter as the main source. 
 
The data is obtained through the streaming API of R. Once captured, I carry out statistical and descriptive analysis, as well as a sentiment analysis. I also construct and analyze the retweet network (most relevant users and tweets, metrics and properties of the network and visualization of the graph). Furthermore, I use wordclouds to display the most frequent words and maps to visualize the most active countries on Twitter. Several of the analyzes are repeated for tweets written in English, Spanish and Catalan, so that we can assess possible differences.
